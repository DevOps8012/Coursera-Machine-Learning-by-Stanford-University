    "    - Any logical function over binary-valued (0 or 1) inputs x1 and x2 can be (approximately) represented using some neural network.\n",
    "    - The activation values of the hidden units in a neural network, with the sigmoid activation function applied at every layer, are always in the range (0, 1). \n",
    "2. Consider the following neural network which takes two binary-valued inputs x1,x2∈{0,1} and outputs hΘ(x). Which of the following logical functions does it (approximately) compute?\n",

    "            - OR\n",
    "3. Consider the neural network given below. Which of the following equations correctly computes the activation a(3)1? Note: g(z) is the sigmoid activation function.\n",

    "5. You are using the neural network pictured below and have learned the parameters Θ(1)=[11−1.55.13.72.3] (used to compute a(2)) and Θ(2)=[10.6−0.8] (used to compute a(3)} as a function of a(2)). Suppose you swap the parameters for the first hidden layer between its two units so Θ(1)=[115.1−1.52.33.7] and also swap the output layer so Θ(2)=[1−0.80.6]. How will this change the value of the output hΘ(x)?\n",
