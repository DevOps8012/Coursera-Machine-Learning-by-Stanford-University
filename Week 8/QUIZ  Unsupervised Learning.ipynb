    "1. For which of the following tasks might K-means clustering be a suitable algorithm? Select all that apply.\n",
    "    - Given a set of news articles from many different news websites, find out what are the main topics covered.\n",
    "    - From the user usage patterns on a website, figure out what different groups of users exist.\n",
    "2. Suppose we have three cluster centroids μ1=[12], μ2=[−30] and μ3=[42]. Furthermore, we have a training example x(i)=[-12]. After a cluster assignment step, what will c(i) be?\n",
    "    - c(i) = 1\n",
    "3. K-means is an iterative algorithm, and two of the following steps are repeatedly carried out in its inner-loop. Which two?\n",
    "    - The cluster assignment step, where the parameters c(i) are updated.\n",
    "    - Move the cluster centroids, where the centroids μk are updated.\n",
    "4. Suppose you have an unlabeled dataset {x(1),…,x(m)}. You run K-means with 50 different random initializations, and obtain 50 different clusterings of the data. What is the recommended way for choosing which one of these 50 clusterings to use?\n",
    "    - For each of the clusterings, compute 1m∑mi=1||x(i)−μc(i)||2, and pick the one that minimizes this.\n",
    "5. Which of the following statements are true? Select all that apply.\n",
    "    - For some datasets, the \"right\" or \"correct\" value of K (the number of clusters) can be ambiguous, and hard even for a human expert looking carefully at the data to decide.\n",
    "    - If we are worried about K-means getting stuck in bad local optima, one way to ameliorate (reduce) this problem is if we try using multiple random initializations."
