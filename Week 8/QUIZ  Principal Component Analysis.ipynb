    "Which of the following figures correspond to possible values that PCA may return for u(1) (the first eigenvector / first principal component)? Check all that apply (you may have to check more than one figure).\n",

    "2. Which of the following is a reasonable way to select the number of principal components k? (Recall that n is the dimensionality of the input data and m is the number of input examples.)\n",
    "    - Choose k to be the smallest value so that at least 99% of the variance is retained.\n",
    "3. Suppose someone tells you that they ran PCA in such a way that \"95% of the variance was retained.\" What is an equivalent statement to this?\n",

    "4. Which of the following statements are true? Check all that apply.\n",
    "    - Even if all the input features are on very similar scales, we should still perform mean normalization (so that each feature has zero mean) before running PCA.\n",
    "    - If the input features are on very different scales, it is a good idea to perform feature scaling before applying PCA.\n",
    "5. Which of the following are recommended applications of PCA? Select all that apply.\n",
    "    - Data compression: Reduce the dimension of your data, so that it takes up less memory / disk space.\n",
    "    - Data visualization: Reduce data to 2D (or 3D) so that it can be plotted."
