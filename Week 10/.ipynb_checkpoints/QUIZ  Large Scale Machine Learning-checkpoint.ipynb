    "1. Suppose you are training a logistic regression classifier using stochastic gradient descent. You find that the cost (say, cost(θ,(x(i),y(i))), averaged over the last 500 examples), plotted as a function of the number of iterations, is slowly increasing over time. Which of the following changes are likely to help?\n",
    "    - Try halving (decreasing) the learning rate α, and see if that causes the cost to now consistently go down; and if not, keep halving it until it does.\n",
    "2. Which of the following statements about stochastic gradient descent are true? Check all that apply.\n",
    "    - You can use the method of numerical gradient checking to verify that your stochastic gradient descent implementation is bug-free. (One step of stochastic gradient descent computes the partial derivative ∂∂θjcost(θ,(x(i),y(i))).)\n",
    "    - Before running stochastic gradient descent, you should randomly shuffle (reorder) the training set.\n",
    "3. Which of the following statements about online learning are true? Check all that apply.\n",
    "    - In the approach to online learning discussed in the lecture video, we repeatedly get a single training example, take one step of stochastic gradient descent using that example, and then move on to the next example.\n",
    "    - When using online learning, in each step we get a new example (x,y), perform one step of (essentially stochastic gradient descent) learning on that example, and then discard that example and move on to the next.\n",
    "4. Assuming that you have a very large training set, which of the following algorithms do you think can be parallelized using map-reduce and splitting the training set across different machines? Check all that apply.\n",
    "    - A neural network trained using batch gradient descent.\n",
    "    - Linear regression trained using batch gradient descent.\n",
    "5. Which of the following statements about map-reduce are true? Check all that apply.\n",
    "    - Because of network latency and other overhead associated with map-reduce, if we run map-reduce using N computers, we might get less than an N-fold speedup compared to using 1 computer.\n",
    "    - When using map-reduce with gradient descent, we usually use a single machine that accumulates the gradients from each of the map-reduce machines, in order to compute the parameter update for that iteration.\n",
    "    - If you have only 1 computer with 1 computing core, then map-reduce is unlikely to help."
