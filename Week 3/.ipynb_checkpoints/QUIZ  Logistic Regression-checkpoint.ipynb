    "1. Suppose that you have trained a logistic regression classifier, and it outputs on a new example x a prediction hθ(x) = 0.7. This means (check all that apply):\n",
    "    - Our estimate for P(y=0|x;θ) is 0.3.\n",
    "    - Our estimate for P(y=1|x;θ) is 0.7.\n",
    "2. Suppose you have the following training set, and fit a logistic regression classifier h_\\theta(x) = g(\\theta_0 + \\theta_1x_1 + \\theta_2 x_2).\n",

    "    - J(θ) will be a convex function, so gradient descent should converge to the global minimum.\n",
    "    - Adding polynomial features (e.g., instead using hθ(x)=g(θ0+θ1x1+θ2x2+θ3x21+θ4x1x2+θ5x22) ) could increase how well we can fit the training data.\n",
    "3. For logistic regression, the gradient is given by ∂∂θjJ(θ)=∑mi=1(hθ(x(i))−y(i))x(i)j. Which of these is a correct gradient descent update for logistic regression with a learning rate of α? Check all that apply.\n",

    "4. Which of the following statements are true? Check all that apply.\n",
    "    - The sigmoid function g(z)=11+e−z is never greater than one (>1).\n",
    "    - The cost function J(θ) for logistic regression trained with m≥1 examples is always greater than or equal to zero.\n",
    "5. Suppose you train a logistic classifier hθ(x)=g(θ0+θ1x1+θ2x2). Suppose θ0=−6,θ1=1,θ2=0. Which of the following figures represents the decision boundary found by your classifier?\n",
